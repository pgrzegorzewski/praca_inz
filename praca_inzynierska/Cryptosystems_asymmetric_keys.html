				<h3>Cryptosystem with asymmetric keys</h3>
				Cryptosystem with asymmetric keys is also known as cryptosystems with public keys. In this cryptosystem each user has got pair of keys where one of them can be used only for encryption and the other one is used only for decryption. Keys are very closely connected with each other however having one of them we are not able to find second one. So even if someone knows encrypting key (that situation always exists in that kind of system) is not able to guess decrypting key from the pair.
				<br><br>So how this system works. Each user who wants to receive confidential messages creates pair of keys. Key responsible for decryption should be available only for him. User is posting his encrypting key in public folder. Now everyone who wants to send to our user encrypted message downloads his key, uses it to create cryptogram and sends him. Receiver can easily retrive the real message because of the fact he has got decrypting key on his own.
				<br>As long as that no one can find decrypting key from the encrypting one the message is a secret for all users of the net despite the receiver.
				<br>

				<br><br>One of the biggest advantages of this cryptosystem is that users are not forced to state the common key before the message transmission.
				<br>However this system has got one crucial disadvantage over the system with symmetric keys which is higher computational complexity of encrypting and decrypting procedures (when we are comparing two cryptograms at the same level of safety).
